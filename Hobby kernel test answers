ADDRESS TRANSLATION SCHEME:is a method used by computer systems to convert virtual or logical addresses generated by a program into physical addresses that are used by the hardware to access memory. This is a critical aspect of modern computer architecture, particularly in systems that implement virtual memory.
ROLE OF OPERATING SYSTEM IN HARDWARE ABSTRACTION: The operating system (OS) plays a critical role in hardware abstraction, which is the process of hiding the complexities and specifics of hardware from applications and users. This abstraction allows software developers to write programs without needing to understand the details of the underlying hardware.
How is QtMU related to QEMU:QtMU is a graphical user interface (GUI) built on top of QEMU, designed to make it easier to manage and use QEMU-based virtual mach.and also QEMU is an open-source emulator and virtualizerand QtMU is a front-end application for QEMU.
THE PURPOSE OF THE aHEX EDITOR IN KERNEL DEVELOPMENT are Analyzing and Debugging Binary Files,Editing Binary Data,Inspecting Memory Dumps,Working with Device Files and Drivers
VSCode recommended as a text editor:is widely recommended as a text editor for various development tasks, including kernel development, for several reasons:Lightweight Yet Powerful,Cross-Platform Support,Rich Extension Ecosystem,Debugging Capabilities.
NASM:is popular assembler used for x86 architecture programming.
SASM:is an integrated development environment for assembly language programming that support and other assemblers.SASM (SimpleASM) and NASM (Netwide Assembler) are both tools related to assembly programming, but they differ significantly in their purpose, functionality, and usage.
