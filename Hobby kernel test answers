ADDRESS TRANSLATION SCHEME:is a method used by computer systems to convert virtual or logical addresses generated by a program into physical addresses that are used by the hardware to access memory. This is a critical aspect of modern computer architecture, particularly in systems that implement virtual memory.
ROLE OF OPERATING SYSTEM IN HARDWARE ABSTRACTION: The operating system (OS) plays a critical role in hardware abstraction, which is the process of hiding the complexities and specifics of hardware from applications and users. This abstraction allows software developers to write programs without needing to understand the details of the underlying hardware.
